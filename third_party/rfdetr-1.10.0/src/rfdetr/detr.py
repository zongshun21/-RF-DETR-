        The correct subclass is resolved in order of preference:

        1. ``model_name`` key in the checkpoint (written by the PTL training
           stack since v1.7.0).
        2. ``pretrain_weights`` field in the checkpoint's ``args`` entry
           (legacy fallback for older checkpoints).
        3. The **filename** of *path* itself, used as a last resort when
           ``pretrain_weights`` is absent or an unset-like sentinel value
           (empty string, ``"none"``, or ``"null"``).  Starter weights
           published by Roboflow store ``pretrain_weights="none"`` in their
           ``args``; passing the canonical filename (e.g.
           ``rf-detr-small.pth``) lets ``from_checkpoint`` infer the class
           automatically.

        Both legacy ``argparse.Namespace`` checkpoints (produced by ``engine.py``) and dict-style checkpoints (produced
        by the PTL training stack) are supported.

        Args:
            path: Path to a checkpoint file (e.g. ``checkpoint_best_total.pth``).
            trust_checkpoint: When ``True``, fall back to ``weights_only=False``
                (full pickle) if safe deserialization fails.  Only set this for
                checkpoints from fully trusted sources; the default ``False``
                keeps the safe loading path and raises if it cannot succeed.
                Applies to both the initial checkpoint read here and the
                constructor's own reload of the same file via
                :func:`~rfdetr.models.weights.load_pretrain_weights`.
            **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments forwarded to the model
                constructor (e.g. ``accept_platform_model_license=True`` for XLarge / 2XLarge models).

                ``num_classes`` is resolved in this priority order:

                1. Explicit caller kwarg — always wins.
                2. Weight inference from ``class_embed.weight`` shape in the checkpoint
                   (``shape[0] - 1``, since the head includes a background class). This
                   overrides a stale ``model_config`` value written before fine-tuning
                   changed the class count.
                3. ``saved_model_config["num_classes"]`` from the checkpoint's
                   ``model_config`` entry — may be stale for older checkpoints.
                4. Legacy ``args["num_classes"]`` dict entry.
                5. Constructor default.

                In cases 2–5 the field is not recorded as a user-set override, so
                :meth:`train` can still adapt the detection head to the training
                dataset's class count.  Pass an explicit ``num_classes=N`` to pin
                the head and prevent adaptation.

        Returns:
            An instance of the appropriate :class:`RFDETR` subclass loaded from the checkpoint.

        Warning:
            By default this method attempts safe deserialization
            (``weights_only=True``).  Pass ``trust_checkpoint=True`` only for
            checkpoints from fully trusted sources, as it enables full pickle
            deserialization which can execute arbitrary code.

        Raises:
            FileNotFoundError: If *path* does not exist.
            OSError: If *path* exists but cannot be read.
            KeyError: If the checkpoint does not contain an ``"args"`` key.
            ValueError: If the model class cannot be inferred from ``model_name``,
                ``pretrain_weights``, or the checkpoint filename.

        Examples:
            >>> model = RFDETR.from_checkpoint("checkpoint_best_total.pth")  # doctest: +SKIP
            >>> model = RFDETRSmall.from_checkpoint("checkpoint_best_total.pth")  # doctest: +SKIP

        All keyword arguments are forwarded to :meth:`get_train_config` to build a :class:`~rfdetr.config.TrainConfig`.
        Several kwargs are absorbed and handled specially so that existing call-sites do not break:

        * ``resolution`` — updates the model's input resolution by mutating
          :attr:`model_config.resolution` in place before the train config is built. This change persists on
          :attr:`model_config` after :meth:`train` returns. The value must be a positive integer divisible by
          ``patch_size * num_windows`` for the model variant; a :class:`ValueError` is raised otherwise.
          :attr:`model_config.positional_encoding_size` is also updated when the config derives it formulaically (``PE
          == resolution // patch_size``); configs with a pretrained-specific PE value (e.g. ``RFDETRBase`` uses DINOv2's
          PE=37 at 560 px) are left unchanged to preserve checkpoint compatibility.
        * ``device`` — normalized via :class:`torch.device` and mapped to PyTorch
          Lightning trainer arguments. ``"cpu"`` becomes ``accelerator="cpu"``; ``"cuda"`` and ``"cuda:N"`` become
          ``accelerator="gpu"`` and optionally ``devices=[N]``; ``"mps"`` becomes ``accelerator="mps"``; ``"xla"``
          becomes ``accelerator="tpu"`` (PTL's canonical name for the XLA backend). Other valid torch device types
          fall back to PTL auto-detection and emit a :class:`UserWarning`.
        * ``notes`` — optional user-defined metadata (string, dict, list, or
          any JSON-serialisable value) stored under the ``"notes"`` key in every ``.pth`` checkpoint produced during
          training.  The value is also available inside ``args["notes"]`` for full provenance.  Pass the same value to
          :meth:`export` to embed it in the ONNX file as well.

        After training completes the underlying ``nn.Module`` is synced back onto ``self.model.model`` so that
        :meth:`predict` and :meth:`export` continue to work without reloading the checkpoint.

        """Evaluate the current model on a dataset split and return COCO metrics.

        Runs a single evaluation pass over the requested split via the PyTorch Lightning stack and returns the COCO
        metrics (mAP, mAR, and the macro-F1 sweep) computed by
        :class:`~rfdetr.training.callbacks.coco_eval.COCOEvalCallback`. The same metrics are also printed to the
        terminal. This works both directly after :meth:`train` and on a model loaded via :meth:`from_checkpoint` — the
        weights already held in memory are evaluated; no checkpoint file is re-loaded.

        Apart from ``split``, this method accepts exactly the same keyword arguments as :meth:`train` (``dataset_dir``,
        ``device``, ``resolution``, ``batch_size``, ``output_dir``, ``num_workers``, ...); they are handled identically
        via the shared :func:`_prepare_run_config`. This parity is for convenience — the same kwargs dict used for
        :meth:`train` can be reused here — not a guarantee every field has an effect. Training-only fields (``epochs``,
        ``lr``, ``weight_decay``, ``ema``, ``early_stopping``, ``run``, ``project``, ``checkpoint_interval``,
        ``tensorboard``/``wandb``/``mlflow``/``clearml``, and similar) are silently accepted and ignored: ``evaluate()``
        runs through an eval-only trainer (``include_training_callbacks=False``) that never builds EMA, drop-path,
        checkpointing, early-stopping, or logger callbacks, so those fields have nothing to attach to.

        Unlike :meth:`train`, this method never adapts the detection head to the dataset: the model is evaluated exactly
        as configured. If the dataset's class count differs from the model's ``num_classes`` a :class:`UserWarning` is
        emitted and evaluation proceeds with the model's head unchanged.

        Unlike :meth:`train`, a ``resolution`` override does **not** persist: :attr:`model_config` (and any cached
        ``model.resolution`` / ``model.args`` inference context) is restored to its pre-call values once the
        eval-only config copy has captured the override, so a later :meth:`predict` / :meth:`export` / :meth:`train`
        call is unaffected by an ``evaluate(resolution=...)`` call.

        Args:
            split: Which split to evaluate. ``"test"`` evaluates the ``test/`` folder (YOLO-format datasets — plain
                YOLO datasets and Roboflow exports whose detected format is YOLO — fall back to the ``valid/`` split,
                with a logged warning, when no ``test`` split can be resolved. A Roboflow export in COCO format has
                no such fallback and still raises ``FileNotFoundError`` when its ``test`` split is missing;
                COCO/Objects365 never attempt ``test`` and always evaluate ``valid/``) via ``trainer.test``;
                ``"val"`` evaluates the ``valid/`` folder via ``trainer.validate``.
            **kwargs: The same keyword arguments accepted by :meth:`train` — ``dataset_dir`` is required (here or
                already on the config), and the rest are forwarded to :func:`_prepare_run_config` /
                :meth:`get_train_config`.

        Returns:
            Mapping of metric name to value for the evaluated split, e.g. ``{"test/mAP_50_95": ..., "test/mAP_50": ...,
            "test/F1": ...}``. Per-class keys (``"test/AP/<class>"``) are included only when
            ``log_per_class_metrics=True`` (default ``False``). Empty when the trainer returns no metrics.

        """Optimize the model for inference with optional JIT compilation and dtype casting.

        Operations are wrapped in the correct CUDA device context to prevent context leaks on multi-GPU setups. When
        ``compile=True`` the model is traced with ``torch.jit.trace`` using a dummy input of ``batch_size`` images at
        the model's current resolution. By default, optimization deep-copies the loaded model before exporting it so the
        original module remains available. Set ``inplace=True`` for memory-constrained inference-only deployments; this
        exports the loaded module itself, may cast it to ``dtype``, and clears ``model.model`` after optimization
        succeeds. In-place optimization is destructive: :meth:`remove_optimized_model` becomes a no-op (issues
        :class:`UserWarning`), and :meth:`export` raises :class:`RuntimeError`. Create or reload a new ``RFDETR``
        instance to recover the original model.

        If ``inplace=True`` and the underlying ``export()`` call mutates the module before raising (e.g. setting
        internal flags and swapping ``forward``), the exception handler resets RFDETR wrapper flags to the unoptimized
        state but cannot undo changes made inside ``export()``. Create a new RFDETR instance for reliable inference
        after such a failure.

        Args:
            compile: If ``True``, trace the model with ``torch.jit.trace`` to obtain
                a JIT-compiled ``ScriptModule``. Set to ``False`` for broader compatibility (e.g. models with dynamic
                control flow).
            batch_size: Number of images the traced model will be optimized for. Ignored when ``compile=False``.
            dtype: Target floating-point dtype for the inference model. Accepts a
                ``torch.dtype`` directly (e.g. ``torch.float16``) or its string name (e.g. ``"float16"``). Defaults to
                ``torch.float32``. When ``dtype`` differs from the model's current dtype, ``to()`` transiently
                allocates both old and new parameter tensors simultaneously; peak memory during optimization is
                approximately 1.5× the model weight size rather than 1×.
            inplace: If ``True``, optimize ``model.model`` directly instead of deep-copying it. This is a destructive,
                inference-only path because ``export()`` mutates the module and dtype casting mutates its parameters.
                Requires ``compile=False``. With the default ``dtype=torch.float32``, the dtype cast is a no-op, so
                memory savings come only from clearing the base model reference rather than from dtype reduction.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If ``dtype`` is not a ``torch.dtype``, or if ``dtype`` is a
                string that does not correspond to a valid ``torch.dtype`` attribute.

                ``compile=True``.

        See the `export documentation <https://rfdetr.roboflow.com/learn/export/>`_ for more information.

        Args:
            output_dir: Directory to write the exported model to.
            infer_dir: Optional directory of sample images for dynamic-axes inference.
            backbone_only: Export only the backbone (feature extractor).
            opset_version: ONNX opset version to target.
            verbose: Print export progress information.
            shape: ``(height, width)`` tuple; defaults to square at model resolution.
                Both dimensions must be divisible by ``patch_size * num_windows``.
            batch_size: Static batch size to bake into the ONNX graph.
            dynamic_batch: If True, export with a dynamic batch dimension so the model accepts variable batch sizes
                at runtime (spatial dimensions always stay fixed).  Applies to the ONNX and TFLite graphs.  Not
                supported for ExecuTorch export on executorch 1.3.1 (raises ``NotImplementedError``): the runtime
                cannot resize RF-DETR's windowed-attention reshapes, so a dynamic ``.pte`` runs only at the traced
                batch — export one ``.pte`` per batch size instead.  Also unsupported for native CoreML
                (``format="coreml"``): fixed shapes are required for reliable ANE / GPU scheduling.
            patch_size: Backbone patch size. Defaults to the value stored in
                ``model_config.patch_size`` (typically 14 or 16). When provided explicitly it must match the
                instantiated model's patch size. Shape divisibility is validated against ``patch_size * num_windows``.
            format: Export format — ``"onnx"`` (default), ``"tflite"``, ``"tensorrt"`` (alias: ``"trt"``),
                ``"executorch"`` (alias: ``"pte"``), or ``"coreml"``.
                ``"tflite"`` and ``"tensorrt"`` both first export to ONNX, then convert: ``"tflite"`` via
                ``onnx2tf`` (requires ``pip install rfdetr[tflite]``); ``"tensorrt"`` via the TensorRT
                Python API (requires ``pip install rfdetr[tensorrt]``).  Unlike ``"onnx"``/
                ``"tflite"`` portable serialization, ``"tensorrt"`` performs target-specific compilation at export
                time and produces a non-portable ``.trt`` engine tied to the build machine's GPU and TensorRT version.
                When ``"executorch"`` is selected the model is exported directly via ``torch.export`` to an ExecuTorch
                ``.pte`` file (no ONNX step), configured by *backend* / *soc* below.  Requires
                ``pip install rfdetr[executorch]``.
                When ``"coreml"`` is selected the model is exported via ``torch.export`` + ``coremltools`` to a
                native ``.mlpackage`` (no ONNX step; requires ``pip install rfdetr[coreml]``). This is distinct from
                ExecuTorch's ``format="executorch", backend="coreml"`` path, which still produces a ``.pte``. If
                you know that ExecuTorch delegate and expect ``format="coreml"`` to mean the same thing: it does
                not — pass ``format="executorch", backend="coreml"`` for the ``.pte`` route instead. Passing both
                ``format="coreml"`` and ``backend="coreml"`` together does **not** fall through to the ExecuTorch
                delegate; ``backend`` is ignored (with a warning) and the native ``.mlpackage`` path always runs.
                Keypoint models are untested with ``format="coreml"`` — detection and segmentation have
                registry-clean and numerical-parity test coverage (see
                ``tests/export/test_coreml_op_coverage.py`` / ``test_coreml_export.py``), keypoint models
                currently do not.

                .. warning::
                    TFLite, ExecuTorch, and CoreML export are experimental and subject to change; upstream dependency
                    instabilities (``onnx2tf``, ``ai_edge_litert``, ``executorch``, ``coremltools``) may affect results.
            quantization: TFLite quantization mode (ignored when
                ``format="onnx"``).  One of ``None``, ``"fp32"``, ``"fp16"``, ``"int8"``.  ``None`` / ``"fp32"`` /
                ``"fp16"`` produce FP32 + FP16 ``.tflite`` files; ``"int8"`` additionally produces an INT8-quantized
                model.
            calibration_data: Representative images for INT8 calibration and ``onnx2tf`` output validation.  Accepts:

                * ``None`` — auto-generate random data (sufficient for fp32/fp16; warns for int8).
                * A **directory path** (``str``) containing JPEG/PNG
                  images — the converter automatically loads, resizes, and prepares them.  This is the simplest
                  approach.
                * A path (``str``) to a ``.npy`` file of shape ``(N, H, W, 3)``, dtype float32, values in ``[0, 1]``.
                * A :class:`numpy.ndarray` with the same format.

                For INT8 quantization, provide 20–100 representative images from your training/validation set for best
                accuracy.
            max_images: Maximum number of images to load from a calibration directory.  Defaults to ``100``.  Only used
                when *calibration_data* is a directory path.
            backend: Hardware backend to specialize the export for.  Required when ``format="executorch"`` and
                ignored — with a warning — for any other format.  Accepted values for ExecuTorch:
                ``"xnnpack"`` (portable CPU, fp32), ``"coreml"`` (Apple devices, fp16; requires ``coremltools``),
                and ``"qnn"`` (Qualcomm Snapdragon HTP, fp16; requires an ExecuTorch source build against the
                QAIRT SDK — not available via pip).
            soc: Target SoC (System on Chip) — the specific Qualcomm Snapdragon chip the exported model will run
                on.  Required when ``backend="qnn"``: the QNN backend compiles the ``.pte`` ahead-of-time for one
                chip's Hexagon Tensor Processor (HTP), unlike ``"xnnpack"``/``"coreml"`` which run on any device of
                their platform, so the target chip must be known at export time.  Ignored — with a warning — for
                any other backend or format.  Must be a
                :class:`~executorch.backends.qualcomm.serialization.qc_schema.QcomChipset` name, e.g. ``"SM8650"``
                (Snapdragon 8 Gen 3); see that enum for the full list of supported chips.  Has no effect for
                ``"xnnpack"`` or ``"coreml"``.
            fp16: Build the TensorRT engine with FP16 precision.  Only applies when ``format="tensorrt"``
                (alias ``"trt"``); ignored for every other format.  Defaults to ``True`` for lowest latency
                on NVIDIA GPUs.  Pass ``False`` to build an FP32 engine — required on TensorRT builds that do
                not expose the FP16 builder flag (``export()`` otherwise aborts while configuring FP16).
            notes: Optional user-defined metadata (string, dict, list, or
                any JSON-serialisable value) to embed in the exported ONNX model under the ``"rfdetr_notes"`` metadata
                property.  When ``None`` no metadata entry is written.  String values are stored verbatim; all other
                types are JSON-encoded so consumers must call ``json.loads()`` to recover a dict or list.  The same
                value can be passed to :meth:`train` so the checkpoint and the ONNX file share the same provenance
                information.  **Ignored for ``format="executorch"`` and ``format="coreml"``**: those artifacts have
                no ONNX-style metadata slot, and a non-``None`` value emits a ``UserWarning`` instead of being
                embedded.
            coreml_precision: ``ct.convert`` compute precision for ``format="coreml"`` — ``None`` (default) or
                ``"float32"`` selects FP32 (tight CPU parity with eager PyTorch); ``"float16"`` selects a smaller
                ANE-oriented bundle (expect larger numeric drift). Ignored for every other format.
            output_name: Full filename override (without extension), e.g. ``"my-model"``. When set, takes
                precedence over the model's variant name (``self.size``) and the exported file is named
                ``{output_name}.{ext}`` verbatim — this also suppresses the ``_fp32``/``_fp16``/``_{backend}``
                detail suffix that would otherwise be appended to encode the resolved precision/backend/SoC
                (see *format* / *coreml_precision* / *backend* / *soc* / *fp16* above). Sanitized against path
                traversal (only the basename, extension stripped, is used). Exception: ``format="tflite"``
                always writes multiple files (one per precision/quantization mode), so the ``_fp32``/``_fp16``/
                ``_dynamic_range_quant`` suffix is unavoidable even with *output_name* set — it becomes the stem
                instead of the model's variant name.
                Exceptions: ``format="onnx"`` with ``backbone_only=True`` appends ``-backbone`` to the filename
                (``{output_name}-backbone.onnx``); ``format="tflite"`` writes separate per-precision files instead
                of a single ``{output_name}.tflite`` file. The TFLite filenames may include a ``_gs_patched`` infix
                before the precision suffix when GridSample ops are patched, e.g.
                ``{output_name}_gs_patched_fp32.tflite``; this is the standard RF-DETR path.

        Returns:
            Path to the exported model file (``.onnx``, ``.tflite``, ``.trt``, ``.pte``, or ``.mlpackage``).

        Raises:

        This method accepts a single image or a list of images in various formats (file path, image url, PIL Image,
        NumPy array, or torch.Tensor). The images should be in RGB channel order. If a torch.Tensor is provided, it must
        already be normalized to values in the [0, 1] range and have the shape (C, H, W).

        Args:
            images:
                A single image or a list of images to process. Images can be provided
                as file paths, PIL Images, NumPy arrays, or torch.Tensors.
            threshold:
                The minimum confidence score needed to consider a detected bounding box valid.
            shape:
                Optional ``(height, width)`` tuple to resize images to before inference. When provided, overrides the
                model's default inference resolution. The tuple should match the resolution used when exporting the
                model (typically a square shape). Both dimensions must be positive integers divisible by ``patch_size *
                num_windows``. Defaults to ``(model.resolution, model.resolution)`` when not set.
            patch_size:
                Backbone patch size used for shape divisibility validation. Defaults to ``model_config.patch_size``
                (typically 14 for large models, 16 for smaller ones). Divisibility is checked against ``patch_size *
                num_windows``.
            include_source_image:
                Whether to attach the original image to the returned prediction. Detection and segmentation outputs use
                ``detections.metadata["source_image"]``. Keypoint outputs use per-object
                ``key_points.data["source_image"]`` because Supervision ``KeyPoints`` currently has no collection-level
                metadata field. Defaults to ``True``. Set to ``False`` to reduce memory use when source images are not
                needed.
            **kwargs:
                Additional keyword arguments.

        Returns:
            A single or multiple Supervision prediction objects. Detection and segmentation models return
            :class:`~supervision.Detections`. Keypoint models return :class:`~supervision.KeyPoints`, with keypoint
            coordinates in ``xy``. Keypoint predictions preserve the detection-level fields produced by RF-DETR:
            ``key_points.detection_confidence`` is the per-object score used by ``threshold``. For keypoint models this
            is the postprocessed detection score and, by default, includes normalized keypoint uncertainty fusion
            controlled by ``model_config.postprocess_trace_alpha``. ``key_points.keypoint_confidence`` is separate: it
            is a ``(num_detections, num_keypoints)`` array of per-keypoint findability scores decoded from the keypoint
            head, not a repeated copy of the detection score. When RF-DETR emits keypoint precision parameters,
            ``key_points.data["covariance"]`` stores per-keypoint pixel-space covariance matrices with shape
            ``(num_detections, num_keypoints, 2, 2)``. ``key_points.data["xyxy"]`` stores the corresponding detection
            boxes as a ``(num_detections, 4)`` array in the same row order as ``key_points.xy`` because Supervision
            ``KeyPoints`` does not have a native bounding-box field. The ``data`` dict also contains ``class_name`` and
            ``source_shape`` as per-object arrays. When ``include_source_image=True`` for keypoint models,
            ``source_image`` is stored as per-object data until Supervision exposes collection-level metadata for
            ``KeyPoints``.

        Note:
            For ``Detections`` outputs, ``source_image`` moved from ``detections.data`` to ``detections.metadata``.
            Update detection callers reading ``detections.data["source_image"]`` to use
            ``detections.metadata["source_image"]``.

        Note:
            ``class_name`` mapping uses one of three modes depending on the checkpoint. For pretrained COCO checkpoints
            (detected when ``model.args.num_classes > len(class_names)`` and ``class_names`` matches
            ``COCO_CLASS_NAMES``), raw COCO category IDs (1–90, sparse) are looked up by category ID rather than by
            position — so ``class_id=18`` yields ``"dog"``, not ``class_names[18]``. For fine-tuned detection and
            segmentation models and active-first keypoint models, ``class_id`` is a 0-based index into
            ``class_names``. In the one-class preview keypoint setup, that means ``class_id=0`` is the foreground
            class and ``class_id=1`` is ``"__background__"``.
            Legacy keypoint checkpoints with ``args.num_keypoints_per_class[0] == 0`` use a background-first layout:
            slot 0 maps to ``"__background__"`` and foreground slots map to ``class_names`` in order.

        Note:
            A CPU tensor image is pinned before its transfer to a CUDA-device model, and that transfer is
            non-blocking; passing a tensor already on the model's accelerator skips this image transfer entirely.
            But with the default ``include_source_image=True``, capturing ``source_image`` from that same tensor
            still does its own separate, blocking ``.cpu()`` call earlier in the loop — so an already-CUDA tensor
            input alone does not make the call fully round-trip-free. Pass ``include_source_image=False`` to avoid
            that copy as well.

            Tensor and non-uint8 NumPy range checks and every input's shape check are evaluated before inference.
            PIL and uint8 NumPy images skip a redundant range scan because their byte-to-float conversion
            guarantees values in ``[0, 1]`` for both. Any resulting ``ValueError`` is raised only after all inputs
            have been inspected, so valid-shaped images later in a multi-image call still have their conversion and
            transfer queued before an earlier validation failure raises.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If ``shape`` cannot be unpacked as a two-element sequence,
                if either dimension does not support the ``__index__`` protocol (e.g. ``float``) or is a ``bool``, if
