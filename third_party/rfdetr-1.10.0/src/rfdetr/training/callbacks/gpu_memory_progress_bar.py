"""Progress bar variants that append CUDA memory metrics to the displayed metrics.

RF-DETR 1.5 reported ``torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated()`` in the training progress bar (``rfdetr.engine``). The
migration to PyTorch Lightning (PR #794) dropped ``engine.py`` entirely, along with that reporting, leaving the stock
``TQDMProgressBar`` / ``RichProgressBar`` with no GPU memory metric. These mixins restore it by overriding
``get_metrics``, the same extension point PTL itself uses for ``RichProgressBar``.

Two metrics, two different scopes — do not conflate them:

``max_mem`` is the peak allocation of the **local process** on ``trainer.strategy.root_device``, formatted as whole MB.
Under DDP only rank 0 renders a progress bar, so the number shown is rank 0's own peak — not a sum, max, or mean across
the cluster. Other ranks may peak higher (uneven batch shapes) without that ever surfacing. This is pre-#794 behaviour,
kept unchanged; it is documented here only because the rank-local scope is not obvious from the rendered label.

``free_mem`` is ``torch.cuda.mem_get_info(device)``'s ``free``/``total`` pair for the **whole device**, formatted as
``"{free}/{total} MB"``. Unlike ``max_mem`` it is **not process-local and not a peak**: it reflects every allocator on
that device — this process, any sibling process sharing the GPU, the CUDA driver's own reserved memory — at the instant
it is read. Under the default caching-allocator behavior, it reflects memory PyTorch's own caching allocator has
actually handed back to the CUDA driver. Freeing a tensor in this process (``del``, going out of scope, the end of a
batch) returns that block to PyTorch's *own* cache for reuse, not to the driver, so in the common case ``free_mem``
does **not** rise just because this process freed something. ``torch.cuda.empty_cache()``, allocator reclamation
triggered by configured thresholds or allocation pressure, a sibling process releasing its own memory, or this
process exiting can move the number. It is therefore closer to "how much room is left for a genuinely new allocation
beyond what every process on the device has already claimed" than to "how much headroom this run has for a bigger
batch": some of that batch headroom is memory this process already reserved but is currently idle in its own cache
(``torch.cuda.memory_reserved() - torch.cuda.memory_allocated()``), which ``free_mem`` cannot see because the driver
already counts it as claimed by this process. On a GPU shared with other workloads the two numbers can diverge a lot
and that is expected, not a bug in either one.

Peak reset: ``on_train_start`` calls ``torch.cuda.reset_peak_memory_stats()``, so each ``trainer.fit()`` reports its own
peak rather than a high-water mark inherited from earlier work in the same process (model construction, a prior
``fit()``, an earlier ``predict()``). This is a **deliberate deviation** from the pre-#794 baseline, which never reset
and therefore reported a cumulative process-lifetime peak. The hook fires on every rank (``ProgressBar.setup`` only
disables *rendering* off rank 0), so each rank restarts its own counter. The call mutates *process-wide* CUDA allocator
state, so anything else reading peak stats for that device — ``DeviceStatsMonitor``, a profiler, user code — sees the
counter restart at every fit. ``free_mem`` has no such reset: it is live, so there is nothing to restart.

Scope: only ``trainer.fit()`` (training and its periodic in-training validation) renders these metrics. A standalone
``RFDETR.evaluate()`` call builds its trainer with ``include_training_callbacks=False``, which still installs one of
these progress bars, but PTL's own ``TQDMProgressBar``/``RichProgressBar`` surface no metrics outside ``trainer.state.fn
== "fit"``: ``tqdm_progress.py``'s ``on_validation_end`` calls ``get_metrics()`` only under that condition, and
``rich_progress.py``'s ``MetricsTextColumn.render`` returns empty text otherwise. Their ``on_test_end`` hooks need no
such gate — neither reads metrics at all, both only reset eval-loop bookkeeping. So no metric, not just ``max_mem``,
reaches the progress bar during a standalone ``validate()``/``test()`` run. That is a PTL-wide constraint predating this
mixin, not a gap in it.

        start of every fit. ``free_mem`` is a **live, whole-device** ``torch.cuda.mem_get_info(device)`` reading with
        no reset step: it includes every allocator on that device, not just this process, and it only reflects memory
        actually handed back to the CUDA driver — freeing a tensor in this process typically does not raise it on
        its own, since PyTorch's caching allocator keeps that block reserved for its own reuse. Explicit cache
        release, allocator reclamation under configured thresholds or allocation pressure, sibling-process release,
        or process exit can change the reading. See the module docstring for the full semantics.
