    Roboflow COCO exports prepend a synthetic root category (``supercategory: "none"``) whose name is reused as the
    ``supercategory`` of every real class. It carries no annotations, yet it consumes a model output slot once the
    category list is turned into contiguous label indices. Removing it keeps class names, class count and label
    remapping in agreement (GitHub #609).

    A category is dropped when it is named as another category's ``supercategory`` **and** no annotation references its
    id. A category whose own ``supercategory`` equals its own ``name`` — the COCO convention for a top-level class such
    as ``{"name": "person", "supercategory": "person"}`` — is not a parent of itself and is therefore kept; the same
    name still counts as a parent when a *different* category groups under it. The annotation guard keeps genuinely
    labelled parents of hierarchical datasets, and is applied per category by its own ``id`` — categories sharing a
    ``name`` are judged independently, so an annotated leaf is never dropped alongside a same-named grouping node. Ids
    are coerced to ``int`` before that lookup, so exports shipping string ids still match ``annotated_ids``. Flat
    datasets — every ``supercategory`` a placeholder — are returned untouched, as is any input where filtering would
    remove everything.

    Args:
        categories: Raw COCO ``categories`` entries; each needs an ``id`` and a ``name``.
        annotated_ids: Category ids carrying at least one annotation, typically from
            :func:`annotated_category_ids`. ``None`` treats every category as unannotated, which is the right default

    2. Optional remapping of sparse COCO category IDs to contiguous 0-based label

    ``remap_category_ids=True`` builds a ``cat2label`` mapping from the annotation file so that IDs are remapped to the
    range ``[0, N)``.  The reverse ``label2cat`` mapping is attached to the underlying COCO API object so that
    :class:`~rfdetr.datasets.coco_eval.CocoEvaluator` can convert predicted label indices back to the original category
    IDs required by pycocotools.  Unannotated grouping categories — the synthetic root that Roboflow COCO exports
    prepend, for example — are excluded by :func:`filter_parent_categories` when ``include_keypoints=False``, so they
    do not consume an output slot; the keypoint path (:func:`_build_keypoint_cat2label`) keeps them.

    ``remap_category_ids`` should be ``True`` for Roboflow / custom datasets (via :func:`build_roboflow_from_coco`) and
    ``False`` (the default) when evaluating pretrained models that were trained with the convention that model output
    slot *k* corresponds directly to COCO category ID *k*.

    Args:
        img_folder: Path to the directory containing the dataset images.
        ann_file: Path to the COCO-format JSON annotation file.
        transforms: Transform pipeline applied to ``(image, target)`` pairs after
            annotation conversion.  ``None`` means no additional transforms.
        include_masks: If ``True``, decode polygon segmentation masks into binary
            tensors and include them in the target dict under the ``"masks"`` key.
        include_keypoints: If ``True``, parse COCO keypoints and include them in
            the target dict under the ``"keypoints"`` key.
        num_keypoints_per_class: Optional keypoint schema describing the number of
            keypoints per class. When provided, keypoints are padded/truncated to ``max(num_keypoints_per_class)``.
        remap_category_ids: If ``True``, build a ``cat2label`` mapping from the
            annotation file that remaps sparse category IDs to contiguous 0-based label indices.  The reverse mapping is
            stored as ``label2cat`` on both this object and the underlying COCO API object.  Defaults to ``False``.
        cat2label: Pre-built ``category_id`` → label-index mapping to adopt verbatim instead of deriving one from this
            split's own annotations.  Requires ``remap_category_ids=True`` and takes precedence over both the detection
            and the keypoint derivation.  :func:`build_roboflow_from_coco` passes the train split's mapping here so
            that validation and test splits share one label space (see :func:`_train_split_cat2label`); ``None`` (the
            default) keeps the split-local derivation.
        draft_size: Smallest source extent the transform pipeline can consume without upscaling, used to enable
            JPEG DCT-domain downscaling during decode (see :meth:`_decode_image`).  ``None`` (the default) decodes at
            full resolution.  :func:`draft_size_for_transforms` derives the value from the pipeline's scales.

    Returns a composed transform that resizes images to the target ``resolution`` (with optional multi-scale jitter),
    applies torchvision-native default augmentations during training, and normalises pixel values with ImageNet
    statistics. Non-empty custom ``aug_config`` values continue to use the optional Albumentations path.

    For the ``"train"`` split the pipeline uses a two-branch ``OneOf`` between a direct resize and a resize →
    random-crop → resize sequence (built via :func:`_build_train_resize_config`), followed by the
    augmentation stack and normalisation.  For ``"val"``, ``"test"``, and ``"val_speed"`` only resize
    and normalisation are applied — no augmentation.

    When *gpu_postprocess* is ``True``, both the Albumentations augmentation wrappers and the ``Normalize`` step are
    omitted from the ``"train"`` pipeline. The ``RFDETRDataModule`` then applies
    augmentation and normalization on the device in ``on_after_batch_transfer`` instead.

        image_set: Dataset split identifier — ``"train"``, ``"val"``, ``"test"``,
            or ``"val_speed"``.
        resolution: Target short-side resolution in pixels.  During validation the
            longest side is capped at 1333 px to preserve aspect ratio.
        multi_scale: If ``True``, sample the resize target from a range of scales
            computed by :func:`compute_multi_scale_scales` instead of using a single fixed size.
        expanded_scales: Passed to :func:`compute_multi_scale_scales`; broadens the
            scale range when ``multi_scale=True``.
        skip_random_resize: When ``multi_scale=True``, use only the largest scale
            and skip random selection among multiple scales.
        patch_size: Model patch size used by :func:`compute_multi_scale_scales` to
            ensure all candidate resolutions are compatible with the backbone.
        num_windows: Number of attention windows; used by
            :func:`compute_multi_scale_scales` to derive candidate resolutions.
        aug_config: Controls the training augmentation backend.  Three states are
            recognised:

            * ``None`` (default) — use the torchvision-native default augmentation
              (``RandomHorizontalFlip(p=0.5)``, gated by ``keypoint_flip_pairs`` —
              see below).  See the ``UserWarning`` emitted at runtime for details
              of this behaviour change.
            * ``{}`` (empty dict) — disable all optional training augmentation
              including the default horizontal flip.
            * non-empty dict — pass to the optional Albumentations backend;
              requires ``rfdetr[augment]`` to be installed.

            Note:
                ``aug_config`` has no effect on ``"val"``, ``"test"``, or ``"val_speed"``
                splits — augmentation is never applied outside of training.
        scale_jitter: If ``True`` (default), the training resize pipeline randomly picks between
            a direct resize (Option A) and a resize → crop → resize sequence (Option B) for scale
            variation.  Set to ``False`` to use Option A only — no random crop, annotations near
            image borders stay intact.
        gpu_postprocess: When ``True``, skip CPU augmentation and
            ``Normalize`` from the CPU pipeline.  The ``RFDETRDataModule`` then applies both augmentation and
            normalization on the GPU in ``on_after_batch_transfer``.  Has no effect on val/test splits.
        keypoint_flip_pairs: Keypoint left/right swap pairs, or ``None`` for a
            detection-only pipeline.  On the torchvision-native default backend
            (``aug_config=None``), an empty list disables ``RandomHorizontalFlip``
            entirely instead of applying it without relabelling — mirroring
            ``AlbumentationsWrapper.from_config``'s existing gating for the same
            sentinel.

    Returns:
        A transform pipeline ready to be passed to :class:`CocoDetection`.

        .. note::
            This pipeline does **not** guarantee that output ``H`` and ``W`` are divisible by ``patch_size *
